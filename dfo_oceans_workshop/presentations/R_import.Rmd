## Data import

- Getting data into R is often the first hurdle to using R
- "Messy" data often creates a second hurdle
    - R life is much easier when dealing with "tidy" data, especially when using packages in the "tidyverse"
    

## What is tidy data? {.build .smaller}

Data organized into tables where:

1. Every column is a different variable
2. Every row is a single observation
3. Each type of observation is in its own table

```{r, out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Figure 12.1 from here: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/tidy-data.html"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/6f1ddb544fc5c69a2478e444ab8112fb0eea23f8/91adc/images/tidy-1.png")
```


## What is the Tidyverse?

- R packages for working with tidy data
    - Includes popular packages such as `readr`, `dplyr` and `ggplot2`
- Workflow based on functions that:
    - Are all simple verbs that do one thing (arrange, mutate, summarize, etc.)
    - Take a data frame as their first argument
    - Let you refer to the columns in that data frame by name
    - Return a data frame
    - Play well with each other

## Data import example {.build}

- Here we'll use the package `readxl` to import data from excel
    - Specifically, lobster movement data from our Eastport Marine Protected Area
    - Data are split into two files: `Duck Islands Movement.xlsx` and `Round Island Movement.xlsx`

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(readxl) # first step is to load the readxl package
?read_excel     # access help file of key function
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(readxl)
```


## Data import example {.smaller}

```{r}
duck <- read_excel("data/Duck Islands Movement.xlsx")
duck
```


## Data import example {.smaller}

```{r}
round <- read_excel("data/Round Island Movement.xlsx")
round
```

## Data import example {.build}

- As shown in the last two slides, typing the object name into the console prints a subset of the table
- You can explore the full table in Rstudio using the `View` function

```{r, eval = FALSE}
View(duck)
View(round)
```

## Data import example

- Have a good look at these data
- Do they fit the defnition of tidy data? In tidy data,

    1. Every column is a different variable
    2. Every row is a single observation
    3. Each type of observation is in its own table

## Data import example

- Untidy aspects of these data
    - There are empty rows
    - There is one empty column
    - Two tables could be one

## Tidy up

>- Next we will use a function from `dplyr` and `tidyr` to tidy these data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr) # load the dplyr package
library(tidyr) # load the tidyr package
```

## Stack the data {.build .smaller}

- The `bind_rows` function from the `dplyr` package binds multiple data frames into one

```{r}
tags <- bind_rows(duck, round)
tags
```



## Drop empty rows {.build}

- The `drop_na` function from the `tidyr` package drops rows containing missing values (`NA`)

```{r}
tidy_tags <- drop_na(tags)
tidy_tags
```


- Huh! What happened? Use `View(tags)` to try and spot the issue
    - There is a `NA` in every row because of the empty column; `drop_na` therefore drops every row


## Drop empty column and empty rows {.smaller .build}

- Here we'll use the `select` function from `dplyr` to keep the main columns
- We'll also use the pipe operator (`%>%`) to run a sequence of operations

```{r}
tidy_tags <- select(tags, SIDE:NOTCH) %>% # step 1: select columns between SIDE and NOTCH
    drop_na() # step 2: take the data from step 1 and drop rows with NA's
tidy_tags
```


## Drop empty column and empty rows

- These data look good, but there is still a problem
- Can you spot it given the output in the next two slides?


## Drop empty column and empty rows

```{r}
select(tags, SIDE, YEAR, TAG, LENGTH, RECAP)
```


## Drop empty column and empty rows

```{r}
select(tidy_tags, SIDE, YEAR, TAG, LENGTH, RECAP)
```


## Drop empty column and empty rows {.build}

- Entries in the RECAP column are sometimes missing
- We need to drop rows using variables that should not be missing
- We can specify columns to focus on using the `drop_na` function

```{r}
tidy_tags <- select(tags, SIDE:NOTCH) %>% 
    drop_na(SIDE, ISLAND, YEAR, TAG)
```

## Tidy data

```{r}
select(tidy_tags, SIDE, YEAR, TAG, LENGTH, RECAP)
```

## Tidy data

- Getting data into R can be easier than getting data into a workable format
- While the table worked up here may look clean, plotting may reval outstanding issues
