# Writing programs to access data on the web

Many online databases can be accessed through a web site/web browser 
which is convenient for users who occasionally download datasets. 
However, some science applications require regular and often daily 
access to these resources, in which case writing a program to download 
the data is very useful. This task can be achieved through Web 
Application Programming Interfaces (web APIs:   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API ). This lesson will cover an 
overview of web APIs, when/why to use a web API, and using scripts to 
download data from example web APIs (e.g. NOAA water levels 
https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/api/ ). We will also present an API 
currently under development here at NAFC which enables users to access 
ocean model data and forecasts (http://navigator.oceansdata.ca/).
