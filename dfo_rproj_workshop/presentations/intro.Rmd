## Objectives {.build}

- Introduce the concept of a Research Compendium
- Demonstrate the set-up and workflow of a compendium
- Give a brief teaser of git and Rmarkdown

## Research Compendium

- What is it?
    - A compendium is a convention for how to organize key files for a project (data, code, text, etc.) into directories
- Why use one?
    - Simplifies file management
    - Streamlines analytical workflows
    - More efficient for you, future you and your collaborators
    - Reproducible and extensible
