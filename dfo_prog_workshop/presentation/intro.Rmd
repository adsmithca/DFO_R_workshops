## Intro

- While R is often thought of as a statistical and graphing system, it is designed around a true computer language
    - It includes **loops**, **conditionals** and **user-defined functions**
    - This allows you to add additional functionality suited to your needs
- Today we will run through the basics of **loops**, **conditionals** and **user-defined functions**
    - We will build a simple age-structured model of population growth to demonstrate their use


    
## Boring, but important elements {.build}

- Data types

- Data structure


Everything in R is an object.

It is important to understand the different data types, data structures, and how to access the elements of these data structures



## Data types  {.smaller .build}

- character, 
    - '2J'
    - 'juvenile'
- numeric 
    - real (double precision), _e.g._ 1.25
- integer
    - 2L (the L tells R to store this as an integer)
- logical
    - TRUE
    - FALSE
- complex
    -  1+4i (complex numbers with real and imaginary parts)
- factors    
    - unordered, _e.g._ 'Treatment', 'Control'
    - ordered, _e.g._ 'High', 'Medium', 'Low'
    
Atomic vector: the vector only holds data of a single type    
    
## Data structures    
```{r, echo=F}
knitr::kable(  dtypes <- data.frame(dimensions = c('1-d','2-d','n-d'), homogenous = c('vector','matrix','array'), heterogenous = c('list','data frame','')))
  
```



## Indexing

The [ ] command

- Vectors: [p] indicates the _p^th^_ position in the vector
- Matrices and data frames: [r, c] indicates the _r^th^_ row, _c^th^_ column


## Special values

- Infinity
    - Inf
    - - Inf

- NaN: Not a number _e.g._ 0/0

- NULL: represents the null object in R:

- NA: is a logical constant of length 1 which contains a missing value indicator

# Back to the interesting part
  
## Age-structured model

- Here's a common equation in fishery science:
    - $N_{a,y} = N_{a-1, y-1} ~ e^{- Z_{a-1, y-1}}$
    - i.e. Abundance $N$ at age $a$ in year $y$ equals cohort abundance in the previous year times total mortality $Z$
    - Have you ever though about how you would translate this to R code?    

# Loops

## Loops {.build}

- Loops are really useful for equations like the cohort model
- The basic structure looks like this:
```{r}
   for (i in 1:3) {
     # do stuff
   }
```
- Great for repeated tasks since it allows code to be executed repeatedly


## Loops {.smaller .build}

- As the loop runs through the sequence, index `i` changes
```{r, comment="  ##"}
   for (i in 1:3) {
     print(i)
   }
```

- The index name does not have to be `i` and the sequence can be a character string
```{r, comment="  ##"}
   for (a in c("age1", "age2", "age3")) {
     print(a)
   }
```



## Cohort model example {.smaller .build}

Let's start simple with the cohort model by tracking one cohort through time ($N_y = N_{y-1} ~ e^{-Z}$)  
Pretend that the the cohort starts at 10000 in year 1 and predict for 10 years assuming Z = 0.5

```{r, comment = "   ##"}
   N <- c(10000, rep(NA, 10)) # create an object to fill inside the loop          
   N
   for (j in 2:11) {
     N[j] <- N[j - 1] * exp(-0.5)
   }
   N
```
Note that we create the object (N) where we will store the values calculated within the loop.

Not doing this is called 'to grow an object', and will considerably slow down your code 



## Cohort model example {.smaller .build}

Let's return to the full equation:

$N_{a,y} = N_{a-1, y-1} ~ e^{- Z_{a-1, y-1}}$

And break this down into a matrix:

$\begin{bmatrix} 
N_{1,1}   &    N_{1,2}                     &   \ldots                    &   N_{1,Y}                              \\ 
N_{2,1}   &    N_{1, 1} ~ e^{- Z_{1, 1}}   &   N_{1, 2} ~ e^{- Z_{1, 2}} &   \ddots                               \\ 
\vdots    &    N_{2, 1} ~ e^{- Z_{2, 1}}   &   \ddots                    &   \ddots                               \\ 
N_{A,1}   &    \ddots                      &   \ddots                    &   N_{A - 1, Y - 1} ~ e^{- Z_{A-1, Y-1}} 
\end{bmatrix}$

So, what's not overly clear in the equation is that **$N$ in year 1 ($N_{a,1}$)** and **$N$ at age 1 ($N_{1,y}$)** needs to be supplied, along with **total mortality ($Z_{a,y}$)**, for the rest of the matrix to be populated by the equation.

## Equation $\rightarrow$ R code {.smaller .build}

```{r}

## Step 1: Define ages and years
ages <- 1:10
years <- 2005:2016

## Step 2: Create an empty matrix
N <- matrix(NA, nrow = length(ages), ncol = length(years),
            dimnames = list(age = ages, year = years))
N

```


## Equation $\rightarrow$ R code {.smaller .build}

```{r}

## Step 3: Make up some numbers for N at age 1, N at year 1 and Z
N[1, 1:12] <- c(10000, 2000, 3500, 1000, 15000, 1500, 700, 300, 500, 200, 400, 5800)
N[2:10, 1] <- c(6000, 3600, 2200, 1300, 800, 500, 300, 200, 100)
N
Z <- 0.5

```


## Equation $\rightarrow$ R code {.smaller .build}

```{r}

## Step 4: Use a loop to fill the matrix
for (i in seq_along(ages)[-1]) {
  for (j in seq_along(years)[-1]) {
    N[i, j] <- N[i - 1, j - 1] * exp(-Z)
  }
}
round(N)

```

## Loop exercise {.smaller}

Let's assume that the proportion of individuals of age 1 in a given year is an important metric you need to obtain, use a for loop + the code below to obtain it

```{r}
## Step 1: Define ages and years
ages <- 1:10
years <- 2005:2016
## Step 2: Create an empty matrix
N <- matrix(NA, nrow = length(ages), ncol = length(years),
            dimnames = list(age = ages, year = years))
## Step 3: Make up some numbers for N at age 1, N at year 1 and Z
N[1, 1:12] <- c(10000, 2000, 3500, 1000, 15000, 1500, 700, 300, 500, 200, 400, 5800)
N[2:10, 1] <- c(6000, 3600, 2200, 1300, 800, 500, 300, 200, 100)
Z <- 0.5
## loop
for (i in seq_along(ages)[-1]) {
  for (j in seq_along(years)[-1]) {
    N[i, j] <- N[i - 1, j - 1] * exp(-Z)
  }
}

## Here is where you calculate the propotion of individuals of age 1 in each year
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
prop_a1 <- (rep(NA, ncol(N)))
for (j in seq_along(years)) {
 prop_a1[j] <- N[1,j] / sum(N[2:10, j])
}
```

## End loop

- Congrats! You've made up some numbers
- But what if you wanted to see what would happen if $Z$ was higher at younger ages or specific years?

# Conditionals

## Conditionals {.build .smaller}

- We sometimes want to do one thing if a condition is true and another if it is false
- This is where `if` and `else` statements come in handy
- Here's how they are structured in R:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
   if (test) {
     # do this
   } else {
     # do this
   }
```

- where `test` is a logical test, like `x > 5`, that evaluates to `TRUE` or `FALSE`

## if ( ) { } else { }. Cohort model example {.smaller .build}

Now, lets modify our cohort model loop to place conditions on $Z$

Assume that $Z$ was 0.9 in 2009, otherwise $Z$ is 0.5  
Let's see how this works


```{r}
for (j in seq_along(years)[-1]) {
  if (years[j] == 2009) {                 # evalues to TRUE or FALSE, depending on the itteration
    Z <- 0.9                              # Z is set to 0.9 if TRUE
  } else {
    Z <- 0.5                              # Z is set to 0.5 if FALSE
  }
  print (paste('year: ', years[j], ' - Z: ', Z, sep = ''))
}
```

## if ( ) { } else { }. Cohort model example {.smaller .build}

Now let's build the full equation

```{r}
for (i in seq_along(ages)[-1]) {
  for (j in seq_along(years)[-1]) {
    if (years[j] == 2009) {                 # evalues to TRUE or FALSE, depending on the itteration
      Z <- 0.9                              # Z is set to 0.9 if TRUE
    } else {
      Z <- 0.5                              # Z is set to 0.5 if FALSE
    }
    N[i, j] <- N[i - 1, j - 1] * exp(-Z)    # Z supplied here changes, depending on the itteration
  }
}
```


## ifelse(test, yes, no) {.smaller .build}

You have reasons to believe all individuals of age 1 died since 2012

First, transform the matrix **N** into a data.frame

```{r}
library(tidyr)
Ndf <- N %>%
  as.data.frame(.) %>%
  tidyr::gather (.) %>%
  cbind(rep(ages, length(years))) %>%
  setNames(c('year', 'n', 'age'))
Ndf
```

## ifelse(test, yes, no), continued {.smaller .build}
Now, let's assign a value of 0 to the column **n** when age == 1 and year >=2012

```{r}
Ndf$n <- ifelse(Ndf$age == 1 & Ndf$year >= 2012, 0, Ndf$n)
filter(Ndf, age == 1)

```


## ifelse VS if(condition){ } else { } {.build}

Which one should I use?

**if (cond) { yes } else { no }**   
- The condition must be of length one (_e.g._ year == 2009)  
- It is a control-flow structure. It was designed to effect programming forks  
- It should be used when you build functions, to run certain parts of function given when given codition is true (one condition, length==1)


**ifelse(test, yes, no)**    
- returns a value with the same length and attributes as _test_  
- ifelse should be used in transforming your data.frame 


## Conditionals exercise

TODO

## End conditionals {.build}

- Great! Loops + conditionals should help you make your computer do lots of your redundant work
- But if you still find yourself doing manual work (e.g. copy/paste/modify, copy/paste/modify), think about using functions

```{r, eval=FALSE}
   if(group == "happy") {
      print("talk about functions :)")
   } else {
      print("end workshop :(")
   }
```

# Functions

## Functions {.build}

- Functions are a core part of R and the ability to make your own functions allows you to add functionality to R to make your life easier
    - It is also possible to make the lives of others easier if you share your functions
        - You could even go as far as making a package
- The syntax for writing a function is:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
   my_fun <- function(formal_arguments) {
     # body; do stuff with the formal_arguments
   }
```


## Functions {.build .smaller}

```{r, eval=FALSE}
my_fun <- function(formal_arguments) {
  # body; do stuff with the formal_arguments
}
```

- Here, `my_fun` is the name of the function
    - Like objects in R, you can name your function just about anything
- `function` indicates to R that you want to make a function
- `formal_arguments` is a series of comma-separated statements of the form `argument = expression`
    - Again, the `argument` name is flexible
    - The `expression` can be a numeric vector, character string, you name it. You can even supply another function.
- Finally, the `body` can be any valid R expression or set of R expressions


## Minus example {.build .smaller}

```{r}
#' Function for substracting two values
#' @param x,y Numeric values to substract (x = 1 and y = 1 are default values)  
minus <- function(x = 1, y = 1) {
  x - y
}   
```

```{r}
minus()                       # defaults are run when values are not supplied
c(minus(3, 10), minus(10, 3)) # you can supply values without names, but remember that order matters!!
minus(y = 10, x = 3)          # order does not matter if you supply argument names
```

## Minus example {.build .smaller}

```{r}
#' Function for substracting two values
#' @param x,y Numeric values to substract (x = 1 and y = 1 are default values)  
minus <- function(x = 1, y = 1) {
  x - y
}   
```

But note that this is a needless function since there is a build in function for subtraction

```{r}
`-`
```



## Cohort model example {.build .smaller}

However, R does not have a built-in function for simulating an age-structured population model

```{r}

#' Simulate age-structured population model
#' @param ages  Ages to include in the simulation
#' @param years Years to include in the simulation
#' @param Z     Total mortality
#' @param R     Recruitment (N at age 1)
#' @param N0    Starting abundance (N at year 1)
sim_pop <- function(ages = 1:10, years = 2005:2016, Z = 0.5,
                    R = c(10000, 2000, 3500, 1000, 15000, 1500, 700, 300, 500, 200, 400, 5800),
                    N0 = c(10000, 6000, 3600, 2200, 1300, 800, 500, 300, 200, 100)) {
  N <- matrix(NA, nrow = length(ages), ncol = length(years),
              dimnames = list(age = ages, year = years))      # start the N matrix
  N[1, ] <- R                                                 # add age 1 vector
  N[, 1] <- N0                                                # add year 1 vector
  for (i in seq_along(ages)[-1]) {
    for (j in seq_along(years)[-1]) {
      N[i, j] <- N[i - 1, j - 1] * exp(-Z)                    # use equation to fill in the rest
    }
  }
  N                                                           # return N matrix
}

```


## Cohort model example {.build .smaller}

Now our code simplifies to this:

N <- sim_pop()
round(N)
```

And if we want to change something, we can use the arguments

```{r}
N <- sim_pop(Z = 1.3)

## Side note on speed

- Slow to fast operations in R:
    - loops with growing objects < loops filling an object < apply functions < fully vectorized functions
- Opinion / observation:
    - Purists R users ruthlessly avoid loops to shave minutes or seconds off their programs
    - Biologists are happy to wait minutes for a loop to finish something that would have taken hours to complete manually
        - Dig into fully vectorized options if your code is slowing you down  
            - base: apply family
             - tidyverse: <img src="rstudio-hex-purrr.png" width="5%" />        
        - Profile your code to find your bottlenecks
