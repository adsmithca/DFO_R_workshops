# What we'll be talking about today:
.huge[
- Why map in R? 
]

--

.huge[
- Short intro to spatial data and GIS concepts
]
--

.huge[
- What are the sp and sf packages, and why does it help to know both?
]

--

.huge[
- How to, for sp and sf: 
]
  - Load maps
  - Putting data with spatial coordinates into R spatial data format
  - Plotting basic maps

--

.huge[
- A quick demo of a couple useful tools: 
]
  - Plotting sf and sp maps in ggplot2
  - Rgooglemaps

# Why map in R?

.huge[
- Makes it easier to get information from maps
]

--

.huge[
- Can map data and model outputs more easily
]

--

.huge[
- It's reproducible]

--

.huge[
- You can make really nice maps]
