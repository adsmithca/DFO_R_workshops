# What we'll be talking about today:
.huge[
- Why map in R? 
]

--

.huge[
- Short intro to spatial data and GIS concepts
]
--

.huge[
- What are the sp and sf packages, and why does it help to know both?
]

--

.huge[
- How to, for sp and sf: 
]
  - Load maps
  - Putting data with spatial coordinates into R spatial data format
  - Plotting basic maps

--

.huge[
- A quick demo of a couple useful tools: 
]
  - Plotting sf and sp maps in ggplot2
  - Rgooglemaps

# Why map in R?

.huge[
- Makes it easier to get information from maps
]

--

.huge[
- Can map data and model outputs more easily
]

--

.huge[
- It's reproducible]

--

.huge[
- You can make really nice maps]

Why do we need special packages for spatial data? It's all lat-long anyway, right?

#What spatial packages do:

* ### Keep track of spatial information:
  * #### polygons, lines, etc.
  * #### datum and projection

--

* ### Keep track of data associated with each spatial object

--

* ### Determine how data should be plotted

--

* ### Calculate spatial transformations and interactions between spatial datasets

---
#The sp package


* .large[The original method of working with spatial data in R]

--

* .large[Stores spatial information seperately from data, in the same] object

--
* .large[Different types of object for different types of spatial data:]
  * e.g. "SpatialPolygons", "SpatialPoints", "SpatialPolygonsDataFrame"

--

* .large[Pros:] 
  * Stable
  * Lots of packages that support it


--


* .large[Cons:]
  * Can be hard to access data
  * Slower than sf
  * Doesn't work with Tidyverse packages


---

#The sp package


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sp)
library(rgdal)

atlantic_map_sp = readOGR("data/map_layers/atlantic_map.shp")
print(atlantic_map_sp)
plot(atlantic_map_sp)
```

---

#The sp package

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(sp)
library(rgdal)

atlantic_map_sp = readOGR("data/map_layers/atlantic_map.shp")
print(atlantic_map_sp)

```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(atlantic_map_sp)

```

]

---
#The sf package
* .large[A newer approach to dealing with spatial data ("simple features")]

--

* .large[Stores spatial data as part of a modified ("sf") data frame]

--

* .large[Different types of object ("sfg") for different data types, but all types can be combined in one column ("sfc") in one data frame ("sf") ]

--
* .large[Pros:]
  * Faster than sp (for most things)
  * Easier to understand objects, that works with Tidyverse
  * Simplier to specify projections and datum
  
--
* .large[Cons:]
  * Currently less package support
  * Still actively in development; Not stable yet
---

#The sf package


```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)

atlantic_map_sf = st_read("data/map_layers/atlantic_map.shp")
print(atlantic_map_sf)
plot(atlantic_map_sf)
```

---
#The sf package

.pull-left[
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(sf)

atlantic_map_sf = st_read("data/map_layers/atlantic_map.shp")
print(atlantic_map_sf)

```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
plot(atlantic_map_sf)
```
